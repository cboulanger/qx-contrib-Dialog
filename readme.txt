Dialog contrib
==============

The Dialog project provides many often-used widgets required in user
interaction, such as alert, confirm, prompt, and others that simplify
the web developer's daily work. 

A special feature are so-called "server dialogs" that can be initiated by
a message from the backend and dispatch an json-rpc request that transports
the user response back to the server. This feature is still experimental
and requires an RPC backend.
